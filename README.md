# BiMap Project

## Description
This project implements a BiMap class for managing key-value pairs with bidirectional access. With BiMap, you can easily add, remove, and search for values, with each value linked to its key and vice versa.

## Requirements
- A C++ compiler is needed to run the code.
- Text files with data (such as cities and representations) should be added to the project directory.
- An additional text file is required for the output.

## Usage
1. Ensure that the required files are present in the project directory.
2. Run the code to test the various functions of BiMap.

## Example Usage
```cpp
BiMap<string, string> bimap;
bimap.insert("Tel Aviv", "Israel");
